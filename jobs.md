## PhD thesis

We currently offer a PhD thesis in the Color Imaging team of the CRIStAL Laboratory, Lille, France, with a starting date around September 2024.

This thesis is about plant recognition in outdoor scenes. 
Previous works tackled this task by multispectral image analysis, requiring the observed plants to be motionless during acquisition. This is a strong limitation for applications in outdoor since plants move due to the wind, in such a way that their leaves and stems can be seen as time-varying textural surfaces. This thesis aims at developing methods to automatically identify such deformable textures by image sequence (i.e., video) analysis.

## MSc Internships

We currently offer a MSc internship in the Color Imaging team of the CRIStAL Laboratory, Lille, France.
This internship can take place anytime between February 2024 and September 2024 and can last between 4 and 6 months.

This internship aims at designing tensor methods for multispectral image demosaicing. The proposed approach will be benchmarked with the matrix-based state-of-the-art on this topic.
It will be tested on real images, e.g., from the CAVE of HyTexila databases.
