We currently offer a MSc internship in the Color Imaging team of the CRIStAL Laboratory, Lille, France.
This internship can take place anytime between February 2024 and September 2024 and can last between 4 and 6 months.

This internship aims at designing tensor methods for multispectral image demosaicing. The proposed approach will be benchmarked with the matrix-based state-of-the-art on this topic.
It will be tested on real images, e.g., from the CAVE of HyTexila databases. 
A detailed proposal, in french and in english, can be accessed here.
