## About

Since November 2021, I am a post-doctoral fellow in <i>CRIStAL (Lille, FR ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·)</i> in the SIGMA team. I work with [Pierre Chainais](http://pierrechainais.ec-lille.fr) and [RÃ©my Boyer](http://pierrechainais.ec-lille.fr).

I obtained the PhD degree from <i>University of Lorraine, CRAN (Nancy, FR ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·)</i>, in October 2021.
I was under the supervision of [David Brie](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Brie) and [Konstantin Usevich](http://w3.cran.univ-lorraine.fr/konstantin.usevich/?q=content/home).

I obtained an engineer degree in 2018 from <i>ENSEM (Ã‰cole Nationale SupÃ©rieure d'Ã‰lectricitÃ© et de MÃ©canique)</i>, as well as a M.Sc from <i>UniversitÃ© de Lorraine</i> in 2018.
