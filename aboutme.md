## About

Since November 2021, I am a post-doctoral fellow in <i>CRIStAL (Lille, FR 🇫🇷)</i> in the SIGMA team. I work with [Pierre Chainais](http://pierrechainais.ec-lille.fr) and [Rémy Boyer](http://pierrechainais.ec-lille.fr).

I obtained the PhD degree from <i>University of Lorraine, CRAN (Nancy, FR 🇫🇷)</i>, in October 2021.
I was under the supervision of [David Brie](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Brie) and [Konstantin Usevich](http://w3.cran.univ-lorraine.fr/konstantin.usevich/?q=content/home).

I obtained an engineer degree in 2018 from <i>ENSEM (École Nationale Supérieure d'Électricité et de Mécanique)</i>, as well as a M.Sc from <i>Université de Lorraine</i> in 2018.

## Research

My current research interests include <b> bayesian tensor approaches for inverse problems</b>.
I am also interested in <b>tensor decompositions, low-rank factorization, multimodal data fusion</b> and performance analysis by means of <b>Cramér-Rao bounds</b>.
This includes applications in <b>astrophysics, remote sensing, and biomedical imaging</b>.
